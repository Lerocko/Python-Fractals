# Fractal Generator - Koch Snowflake

This is a Python project to generate Koch Snowflake fractals using `matplotlib` and `numpy`.  
It demonstrates recursion, vector math, and interactive user input.

## Features
- User-defined number of vertices (triangle, square, etc.)
- Regular or random fractal shapes
- Optional inversion of fractal orientation
- Interactive drawing (see the fractal forming step by step)

## How to Run

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy

    Run the script:

    python "4. FRACTAL_LEO M_251001.py"

    Follow the prompts to customize your fractal:

        Enter the number of vertices (>=3)

        Choose whether you want a regular or random fractal

        Choose whether to invert the fractal orientation

        Optionally, generate another fractal after finishing

Future Improvements

    Add GUI for better interactivity

    Save generated fractals as image files

    Support more fractal types

    Allow adjusting fractal size or depth dynamically
